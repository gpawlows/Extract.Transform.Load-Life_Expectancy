Project Title - Extract, Transform, Load - Life Expectancy 

Team Members - Parth Korat, Geoff Pawlowski, Ashutosh Sawant

Project Description/Outline:

Longer life; this is a universal goal that the world’s countries have been trying to achieve for its peoples’ since countries first came to be.  The good news is that the world has been wildly successful at extending life over the past two (2) centuries.  The more inconclusive news is that different countries have achieved varying results over time.  This is not unexpected as different countries develop at different rates.  Figure 1 is just one (1) example of how two countries can have very different life expectancy curves, relative to time.  However, with many datasets available to us at this time in history, we are hoping to take advantage of the stratification in life expectancy between countries and several other quantifiable variables.  We intend to extract this data, clean it and store it for potential analysis.
